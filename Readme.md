# Explanation of create_hex_project.py

The given code is a Python script that can be used to create a new project structure for a Python application. The script takes a project name as an argument and creates a new directory with that name in the current working directory. The script then creates a basic project structure with the following directories:

application
domain
infrastructure
interfaces
The script also creates a init.py file in each directory to initialize the package. The init.py file contains a description of the package and some boilerplate code.

`(The definition/use case for each folder is in the __init__.py file also in the script in the variable descriptions)`

The script can also be used to create a new environment for a project. The script installs Poetry, Commitizen, and pre-commit in the project directory and initializes Git and Commitizen. The script also configures a git alias for committing changes using Commitizen.

Overall, the given code is a useful tool for creating a new project structure for a Python application. The script can save time and effort by automating the process of creating directories and files.
