        "that coordinate tasks using the domain models. For example, it might include a "
        "module for processing new user registrations, where it would use domain services "
        "to verify user data and infrastructure services to store the user."
    ),
    "domain": (
        "# The domain layer is the heart of the business logic. It encapsulates the business "
        "rules, models, and exceptions that define the operations and constraints of the "

        "These exceptions handle cases that are outside the normal flow of the application, "

    ),
    "domain/repositories": (
        "# Repositories within the domain layer are interfaces that abstract the retrieval "
        "of domain objects from data stores. They define the methods needed to query and "
        "persist domain entities. For example, an 'OrderRepository' might declare methods "
        "like 'find_by_id' and 'save' which would be implemented in the infrastructure layer."

        "# The infrastructure layer provides implementations for the interfaces defined in the "
        "domain layer. It typically includes data access logic, file storage logic, and external "

        "'IEmailService' interface using a third-party email service provider."
    ),

    "infrastructure/db": (
        "# This package is dedicated to database configurations, connection management, and migrations. "
        "It contains the setup needed to connect to a SQL or NoSQL database and might include scripts "
        "or tools like Alembic to handle database versioning and migrations."
    ),
    "infrastructure/repositories": (
        "# Here you'll find the concrete implementations of the repository interfaces defined in the "
        "domain layer. These implementations are specific to the data storage solutions being used, "
        "such as a 'MongoDBOrderRepository' for storing orders in MongoDB."
    ),
    "infrastructure/services": (
        "# The services package within the infrastructure layer contains implementations of services "

        "# The interfaces layer defines the contracts for how external entities interact with the "
        "application. This includes RESTful APIs, GraphQL endpoints, and CLI interfaces. They are "

        "representation of data."

    "interfaces/api_rest": (
        "# This package contains all the components needed to build a RESTful API interface. It defines "
